# CowJS

CowJS is an easter egg for people who look at your javascript console. It takes
input from keypresses on your website, and prints beautiful cowsays to your
console. It works when you're focused anywhere on the document, including input
boxes. Try the live demo on my website here: [https://owen.cafe/](https://owen.cafe/)

## How to use

1. Open your javascript console
2. Refocus your webpage
3. Type some amusing quips
4. Press Enter

## Features

* Cow nesting
* Paste support
* Neat line wrapping
* 58 physical lines of code
* One cow fits all

## How to put this on your site

1. Host cow.js
2. Put a script tag, linking to your hosted cow.js, inside the body tag of your
   site
