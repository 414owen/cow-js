# CowJS

CowJS is an easter egg for people who look at your javascript console.  
It takes input from keypresses on your website, and prints beautiful cowsays to  
your console.
It works when you're focused anywhere on the document, including input boxes.

## How to use

1. Open your javascript console
2. Refocus your webpage
3. Type some amusing quips
4. Press Enter

## How to put this on your site

1. Host cow.js
2. Put a script tag, linking to your hosted cow.js, inside the body tag of your
   site
